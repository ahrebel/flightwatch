# FlightWatch

FlightWatch is a simple and effective Python application that helps you track flight prices and receive email alerts when the prices drop below your set threshold. This tool allows you to either:
- Input specific flight details (airline, flight number, connections, etc.) for tracking, **or**
- Define broad search criteria (preferred airlines, max connections, price limit) to automatically track the best flights.

It scrapes Google Flights for real-time price updates and notifies you when a good deal is found.

## Features
- ðŸ“Œ **Easy-to-use GUI**: Add flights manually or set criteria for automatic tracking.
- âœˆ **Automated Web Scraping**: Uses BeautifulSoup and Requests to fetch flight prices from Google Flights.
- ðŸ“‰ **Email Alerts**: Get notified when the price drops below your specified maximum.
- ðŸ•’ **Daily Price Check**: Runs every day at 8:00 AM automatically.
- ðŸ—„ **CSV Storage**: Keeps track of all flight entries in a local CSV file.
- ðŸ”Ž **Flexible Search Options**: Search by specific flights or broad criteria (airline, connections, price).
